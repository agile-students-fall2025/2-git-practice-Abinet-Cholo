## 🧐 What I Find Interesting

I came across the Netguru article, *“11 Software Development Best Practices in 2025”*, which gives a fresh and current perspective on what practices are trending or becoming more important now.

A few things stood out to me:

- The continuous relevance of principles like **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** and **YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)**. Even though these have been around for a long time, the article shows how they’re still crucial in avoiding unnecessary complexity.  
- The emphasis on **embracing AI assistance**, which is newer in many teams’ practices. It’s interesting to think about the balance between human judgment and machine help—automated code reviews, refactoring suggestions, etc.  
- How many practices are not just technical, but also about team habits: style guides, naming conventions, code reviews. These soft / process-y practices often make a big difference in maintainability and teamwork.

## ✅ Why Sharing This Publicly

I believe these practices are really helpful to keep in mind—especially when starting new projects or when working in teams. They encourage clean code, easier collaboration, and long-term sustainability. If many of us adopt even a few of them, our workflows may become smoother, and our codebases more maintainable.
